# Prompt 1

Help me create a program to extract all historical data from my solar inverters API.

I have attached multiple files to aid in understanding the inverter and the web portal for data access:
* The inverter model is Sunsynk 5.5kW hybrid inverter, I have attached the inverter user manual
* The inverter uses a datalogger to upload data from the inverter to the Sunsynk Connect portal available here https://sunsynk.net. I have attached the datalogger user manual also
* The Sunsynk Connect portal has an API, which the knowledge base includes an example of how to get your access_token. I've attached this API token HTML file provided with this
* There is a separate web link which I think is used for the API here https://api.sunsynk.net
* sunsynk-api-client-main.zip is a github repository of an API client created 2 years ago
* sunsynk-node-api-client-main.zip is a github repository of another API client created 2 years ago
* sunsynk_get_generation.py is a simple Python script designed to retrieve the plant id and current power generation data from a Sunsynk inverter. I have attached the readme sunsynk_get_generation-readme.txt
* sunsniff-main.zip is a github repository that collects data from a Sunsynk/Deye router and makes it available for use
